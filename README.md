# LiTScript Extras

This package contains extra visualizers for [LiTScript](https://johtela.github.io/litscript). Currently it contains:

- SVG graph generator for dependency graphs.
- Test runner that can be used to both in node and in browser. As a visualizer
  it shows results inside a documentation page. When run with node it outputs
  test results to console. It uses [zora](https://github.com/lorenzofox3/zora)
  testing framework in the background.
